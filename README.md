# Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This project is part of my learning journey in the AIAccelerator course. I implemented a K-Means Clustering model to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

### Key Technical Steps:

Data Cleaning: Handled numerical and categorical features.

Optimal K Selection: Used Elbow Method (Inertia) and Silhouette Score to find the best number of clusters.

Visualization: Created scatter plots to analyze the clusters.

### Tools Used:

Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn.

Note: This project was completed as an implementation task during my AI specialization.
